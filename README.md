#Orion Robotics Roboclaw Library

This library includes all of the necessary functions and features in order to get off the ground and start running using orion robitic's roboclaw dual channel motor controller. This Library utilizes the spark core's Serial1 port for communication

##About the Roboclaw

The RoboClaw HV 2x60A motor controller 60V is an extremely efficient, versatile, dual channel synchronous regenerative motor controller. It can supply two brushed DC motors with 60 Amps continuous and 120 Amps peak. The Roboclaw HV 2x60A 60V also support main battery voltages upto 60v.

RoboClaw supports multiple sensor inputs including dual quadrature encoders with up to 19.6 million pulses per second, potentiometers and absolute encoders.With dual quadrature decoding you get greater control over speed, velocity and direction. Automatically maintain speed and direction even if the load changes. With the ability to use potentiometers you can easily create giant servo systems and control them from any of RoboClaw's interface modes.

The RoboClaw motor controller comes equipped with several built in modes to controller your motors. Use standard RC receiver/transmitter, serial devices, analog sources or a microcontroller such as an Arduino.

As a synchronous regenerative motor controller RoboClaw will charge the attached battery during a slow down or breaking action. With the advance circuitry it can also change direction during full throttle without damage! RoboClaw also incorporates a lithium cutoff mode which protects your batteries from damage. Get the power to win your next robotics competition!
